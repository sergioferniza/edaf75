# EDAF75 Lab 2:


## Lab 2 Answers:

##### 4(a) Which relations have natural keys?
* Ticket_id is a natural key
* Username is a natural key
* Theatre name is also a natural key given that the spec says that each name is unique
* Movie title is a natural key (given the 1 year unique name assumption in the spec)

##### 4(b) Is there a risk that any of the natural keys will ever change?
* asdf

##### 4(c) Are there any weak entity sets?
* asdf

##### 4(d) In which relations do you want to use an invented key. Why?
* Ticket and performance?

##### 6 There are at least two ways of keeping track of the number of seats available for each performance â€“ describe them both, with their upsides and downsides.
* Method 1:
* Method 2:

## Work Log:
### Jacob:
2/5/23:
* Cleaned up initial DB scheme from Sergio
* Added `lab2-nb.ipynb` file to repo
* Added CSV sample data files (used in DB setup)
* Created this `README.md` file
* Added the .drawio files with our UML diagrams

2/6/23:
* Continued updating DB schema and SQL script
* Added SQL code to manually insert all entries into Performance table
* Created a shared `lab2-answers.md` file for us to collaborate on lab question answers

### Sergio:
asdf

### Tom
2/6/23:
* started bullet point answers for the questions from requirement 4 above
* Added SampleData_Theater into DB
* Added SampleData_Ticket into DB


## Note:
For testing, we can quickly add data from a .csv
file instead of using lots of
```sql
INSERT OR REPLACE
INTO   TABLE(param1, param2, param3)
VALUES ('asdf', 'asdf', 'asdf'),
...
```
in our DB setup .sql scripts
**BUT the instructions do suggest some manual
statements like that.**
<br> <br>
To do this, I suggest creating the data in Excel,
then saving it as a CSV (comma delimited) file,
and removing the header (first row) in a text
editor.
Now, you can import the data using the following
SQL command with the `$$` variables filled in:
```sqlite3
.mode csv $TABLE_NAME$
.import $FILE_NAME$.csv $TABLE_NAME$
```
To recreate the .sqlite database file, run the following shell command
```
sqlite3 theaters.sqlite < $SQL_SCRIPT$.sql
```

**For submission, rename SQL file and DB file**: <br>
SQL file should be `lab2.sql` and
DB file should be `movies.sqlite`

## E/R - UML Diagrams
I noticed we forgot to add one attribute to
our `Performance` table: `performance_time`
which is the `DATE` data type. I already
added this to my cleaned up SQL script.

## Foreign Key Referencing
1. When we add data to the `Ticket`, a random UUID is created for `TicketId`. How can we use the same UUIDs in the `Performance` table?
