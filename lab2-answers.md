## Question 4:
### (a) Which relations have natural keys?
* Ticket_id is a natural key
* Username is a natural key
* Theatre name is also a natural key given that the spec says that each name is unique
* Movie title is a natural key (given the 1 year unique name assumption in the spec)

### (b) Is there a risk that any of the natural keys will ever change?
* asdf

### (c) Are there any weak entity sets?
* asdf

### (d) In which relations do you want to use an invented key. Why?
* Ticket and performance?
